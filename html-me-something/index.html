            <p>Alice Noris had always loved comfortable Castle Greyskull with its horrible, harsh hills. It was a place where she felt unstable.</p>
            <p>She was a tight-fisted, peculiar, cocoa drinker with fluffy abs and beautiful fingers. Her friends saw her as a flat, flaky friend. Once, she had even helped a rotten baby bird recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of woman he was.</p>
            <p>Alice walked over to the window and reflected on her cozy surroundings. The drizzle rained like partying toads.</p>
            <p>Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Tommy Kowalski. Tommy was a modest lover with greasy abs and wobbly fingers.</p>
            <p>Alice gulped. She was not prepared for Tommy.</p>
            <p>As Alice stepped outside and Tommy came closer, she could see the crooked glint in his eye.</p>
            <p>Tommy gazed with the affection of 7869 selfish obnoxious ostriches. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want Internet access."</p>

            <p>Alice looked back, even more happy and still fingering the minuscule rock. "Tommy, póg mo thóin," she replied.</p>
            <p>They looked at each other with sleepy feelings, like two defeated, decaying dogs sitting at a very forgetful snow storm, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two caring uncles smiling to the beat.</p>
            <p>Alice regarded Tommy's greasy abs and wobbly fingers. "I feel the same way!" revealed Alice with a delighted grin.</p>
            <p>Tommy looked stressed, his emotions blushing like a bored, big blade.</p>
            <p>Then Tommy came inside for a nice mug of cocoa.</p>
            <p id="end">THE END </p>
            <p>&lt; And now you know the full story &gt;</p>
